# med-price -- a Utility for calculating Price Components according to the german AmPreisV

med-price is a command line utility to calculate a list of price components of a pharmaceutical with a given price (either the total retail price, or the price of acquisition for a pharmacy). It is tailored for the german market wherein the prices of prescription drugs are regulated by law. This project is just a pet project of mine written in rust.
